# TD (Todo CLI)
This is a fun project I am working on to help learn Golang.
Feature ideas and feedback on the Golang code is welcome ü§ù.

**Note: These docs have been updated for the upcoming version. If you would like to use 0.0.1, view the instructions [here](https://github.com/tmobaird/td/blob/58f6f37468b30ebfc8db83538deff3c2532b01b7/README.md#installation).

### Installation

  ```

### LLM Prompt Ideas

Schedule should have an LLM and Calendar integration something like:

```
Here are my tasks and some notes about them for today (ordered based on importance):
- task 1
- task 2
- task 3

Here is my calendar for today (you can assume not accounted for time is free time):
- 9-9:30 AM Standup
- 11:45 - 12:45 PM Meeting
- 12:45 - 1:30 PM Lunch

Generate a schedule for my tasks, when I should do them and in what order.
The logic should try to factor in the following:
- Prioritization (ordering)
- Time necessary (if duration not estimated in work notes, assume anywhere between 30-90 minutes)

Return the results in the following structure:
interface ScheduledTask {
  name: string,
  id: string,
  start_time: datetime,
  end_time: datetime
}[]

A single task can have multiple entries, if the suggested approach is breaking them up over multiple blocks.
The list should be sorted based on time.
