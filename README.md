# TD (Todo CLI)

This is a fun project I am working on to help learn Golang.
Feature ideas and feedback on the Golang code is welcome ü§ù.

### Installation

```bash
export TD_DOWNLOAD_VERSION="0.0.1"
export TD_DOWNLOAD_URL="https://github.com/tmobaird/td/releases/download/$TD_DOWNLOAD_VERSION/td.tar.gz"
export BINARIES_PATH="$HOME/bin"
mkdir -p /tmp/td-download
wget -O - "$TD_DOWNLOAD_URL" | tar -xz -C /tmp/td-download
mkdir -p $BINARIES_PATH
mv /tmp/td-download/build/td $BINARIES_PATH
chmod +x "$BINARIES_PATH/td"
```

### Usage

TD is a CLI allows for local todo list management. The interface
documentation can be seen below.

```
Usage: td [options] [command] [arguments]
Options:
  -h, --help     Print usage

  d,  delete <index|uuid>             Delete a todo
  do, done   <index|uuid>             Mark a todo as done

  e,  edit   <index|uuid> <new name>  Edit a todo
  r,  rank   <index|uuid> <new rank>  Rerank a todo
```

- [x] Prioritize items in list
- [x] Catch errors when not enough inputs for command
- [x] Change persistence directory to ~/.td
- [x] Release 1
- [ ] Restructure project directories
- [ ] Persistent configurations
    - [x] Dont show completed
    - [x] Default config does not show completed
    - [ ] Multiple todo lists
    - [ ] Switch ranking to be done through UUID so that indexes can be remove completed indexes
- [ ] Subtodos


# V2 Features
- Basic todo lists
  - done/not done
  - prioritizing
  - CRUD
- Open in editor
- Type of task
- Multiple contexts/domains (todo groups)
- Estimated duration
- Added at, finished at
- Scheduler

# Interface ideas

```
‚úÖtd config              # shows or edits the config
‚úÖtd context             # shows current context
‚úÖtd context "new"       # sets context to new
‚úÖtd ls                  # lists todos, should include filters --type="admin"
td open                # opens current context todo list in $EDITOR
td add "item"          # adds new todo
td mv "item" name      # edits name of item
td rank "item" rank    # moves item up or down in list
td rm "item"           # deletes item from list
td done "item"         # marks as done
td undone "item"       # marks as not done
td schedule            # shows the schedule or generates it if not saved
td schedule --generate # refreshes the last schedule
```

Schedule should have an LLM and Calendar integration something like:

```
Here are my tasks and some notes about them for today (ordered based on importance):
- task 1
- task 2
- task 3

Here is my calendar for today (you can assume not accounted for time is free time):
- 9-9:30 AM Standup
- 11:45 - 12:45 PM Meeting
- 12:45 - 1:30 PM Lunch

Generate a schedule for my tasks, when I should do them and in what order.
The logic should try to factor in the following:
- Prioritization (ordering)
- Time necessary (if duration not estimated in work notes, assume anywhere between 30-90 minutes)

Return the results in the following structure:
interface ScheduledTask {
  name: string,
  id: string,
  start_time: datetime,
  end_time: datetime
}[]

A single task can have multiple entries, if the suggested approach is breaking them up over multiple blocks.
The list should be sorted based on time.
